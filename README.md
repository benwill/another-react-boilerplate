# Another react boilerplate

A very simple boilerplate for starting a react/redux/react-router/webpack project.

#Tech

Redux & react router
Webpack for bundling (babel, bootstrap loader, sass-loader..)
React-css-modules
Chai & Mocha for unit tests

## Tests

```bash
npm test
```

## Linting (ESLINT)

```bash
npm run lint

If issues with estraverse-fb missing, install it without --save, eslint has removed it as a dependency but the babel parser requires it, should be fixed next version.
```

## Installation

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
